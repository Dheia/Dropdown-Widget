# Dropdown Widget

This is a mirror of [Playground for OctoberCMS](https://github.com/daftspunk/oc-test-plugin) to demonstrate the dropdown widget.

### Introduction
You can make filters using the filter option in OctoberCMS. But this does not include a dropdown filter. I needed this functionality and so made this widget to help achieve this. I am using this widget as part of the [Mobile plugin](http://octobercms.com/plugin/mohsin-mobile).
